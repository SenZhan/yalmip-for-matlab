# yalmip_for_matlab
This is a simple code to solve LP problems with yalmip and solvers, very simple and nice to begin with!
Note that i did not specify any solver, which is because i wanted to use lpsolve originally, i took a whole night doing it,
but it turned out that it is not applicable.
Life is like this, sucks sometimes.
